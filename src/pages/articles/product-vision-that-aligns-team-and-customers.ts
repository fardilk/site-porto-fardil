  content: `Great product vision isn’t a poster on the wall; it’s a decision tool your team reaches for when tradeoffs get hard. The best visions are practical, clear, and memorable. They describe a future state that customers recognize as valuable and that the team can translate into roadmaps without guessing. When a vision is real, you’ll hear engineers and designers invoke it in standups (“Which option gets us closer to self-serve onboarding by default?”), and you’ll hear customers echo it in their own words (“You’re the first tool that lets me do this without a specialist”).

Start by sharpening the problem and the audience. “We help small service businesses get paid on time without back-and-forth” is more actionable than “We revolutionize payments.” Add observable success criteria: what changes for your user in the first 90 days? Maybe it’s “reduce invoice aging from 21 days to 7,” or “cut onboarding clicks by 60%.” These are not roadmap items; they’re the yardsticks by which you judge whether you’re moving toward the vision.

Next, write non-goals for this year. Non-goals are liberating. They say, out loud, which good ideas you will not pursue yet. “No marketplace features in 2025,” “No custom workflows for enterprise,” or “No native desktop app” can be the difference between focused progress and diffuse, demoralizing work. Non-goals reduce thrash, protect team energy, and create air cover when you decline well-meaning requests.

Translate the vision into a handful of capability bets. Think of capabilities as verbs your product should perform reliably and delightfully. For our payments example, capabilities might include “collect payments automatically,” “resolve disputes quickly,” and “provide clear, proactive status.” Each capability then spawns outcome-oriented initiatives: “increase auto-collection rate from 35% to 70%,” or “reduce median dispute time from 10 days to 3.” The roadmap remains flexible on solutions while staying firm on outcomes.

Bring customers inside the vision. Share a one-page narrative with three pieces: the current pain (in your customers’ words), the envisioned flow (with a simple diagram), and the measurable outcomes. Invite 5–7 customers to a short call—no slides, just the one-pager. Ask where the story feels off. Ask what you’d need to change to make them switch immediately. You’ll learn which words resonate and which are empty calories.

Internally, socialize the vision with constraints. Engineers don’t need poetry; they need clarity. Answer the basics: What performance budgets are non-negotiable? What privacy and compliance constraints are in play? What manual work are we willing to accept in the first phase? Constraints remove ambiguity and let teams make fast, aligned decisions without waiting for permission.

Make the vision visible where work happens. A short doc pinned in Slack and your project tool beats a mural buried in a drive. Keep it to one screen. Include the one-sentence vision, the audience, the three capability bets, the top two success metrics, and the non-goals. If it doesn’t fit on a page, it won’t fit in anyone’s head.

Review progress monthly in terms of the vision, not just tickets closed. Pull a simple scorecard: Are we closer to the outcomes? What did we learn that changes our assumptions? What’s blocking the capability bets? If a metric is flat, don’t blame effort—interrogate the strategy. Perhaps the bet is right but the tactic is wrong; perhaps the bet itself needs reframing.

Expect tradeoffs. A clear vision helps you say no: to a bespoke customer request that serves one account but undermines your default path, to a flashy feature that would be hard to maintain, to a technical rewrite that delays outcomes by a quarter without unlocking new capabilities. When you do say yes to a deviation, be explicit about why and for how long. Temporary exceptions are fine; accidental strategy is not.

One practical pattern: draft your vision at three altitudes. The “headline” is what you’d print on a billboard—short and sticky. The “narrative” is a single page with the story and outcomes. The “appendix” collects assumptions, constraints, and rejected options. This layered format lets executives, customers, and builders engage at the right depth without losing consistency.

Finally, measure morale alongside metrics. A vision that aligns team and customers should also energize the people doing the work. In retros, ask: Does the vision help you decide? Where does it get fuzzy? What feels out of scope but keeps creeping in? Use those answers to refine the non-goals and the wording. If the team can’t remember the vision, it’s too long. If customers don’t recognize themselves in it, it’s too generic. Keep editing until both problems disappear.

Great product vision is not about predicting the future; it’s about choosing a direction that makes today’s decisions easier. When the vision is clear, non-goals are explicit, and capabilities are outcome-framed, you unlock faster delivery and more coherent product stories. Customers feel the difference in fewer steps, fewer surprises, and more progress where it matters: in the jobs they hired you to do.

If you read only one line, make it this: write a vision your team can use without you in the room—and that your customers could repeat without seeing your deck.`,
