        { type: "paragraph", text: "Whoa, this is my first article—welcome to my blog! I just want to share some personal thoughts." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Yes, it's a two-year timeskip. The tough tech winter is slowly getting better. I'm feeling optimistic again, chasing my dream to become the best <a href='/tags/product-manager' class='text-accent underline'>Product Manager</a> in the country." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Two years of timeskip doesn't mean no effort. Like the Straw Hat Pirates, I spent this time sharpening my skills to become more mature." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Now, I'm confident to show off to recruiters, CEOs, and investors. You're in the right place to find someone who fits your product needs." },

        { type: "paragraph", text: "Here are 11 reasons why you should hire me as your Product Manager:" },
        { type: "heading", level: 1, text: "1. A full‑stack, versatile PM you can employ today" },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Recruiters should hire Fardil now because he is a truly versatile, full‑stack product manager who can jump between strategy, discovery, and execution without hand‑offs. He connects customer problems to measurable outcomes, writes clearly, aligns stakeholders fast, and unblocks delivery. That range lowers coordination cost, speeds learning loops, and keeps the roadmap honest." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Beyond the PM core, he brings cross‑discipline skills that compound: SEO and content systems for organic growth; UX thinking and interaction design; finance and accounting literacy to model ROI; practical visual design; confident public speaking; fluent, precise English; and, most importantly, the ability to code. That rare mix lets him partner deeply with engineers and ship thin, high‑quality slices." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Generalist range matters in PM. I can go broad to find the real problem and go deep to remove risk in the tricky parts—data, flows, edge cases, or system limits. That lets me frame bets, slice deliveries, and keep quality high while still moving quickly." },

        { type: "heading", level: 1, text: "2. Self‑built portfolio website" },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "While many candidates don’t even maintain a portfolio site, I built this one end‑to‑end myself. It proves I can navigate constraints, take initiative without being asked, and deliver a complete product experience from concept to deployment. I set up routing, accessibility, SEO, and performance budgets, and I keep shipping improvements instead of waiting for a perfect brief." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "The stack is modern and pragmatic: React + TypeScript + Tailwind on the front end, with a Go (Golang) backend. I designed the components, wrote the styles, configured tooling, and automated prerender/OG tags so content shares cleanly on social. Building the portfolio myself demonstrates the same bias to action I bring to product teams." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Because I run the whole stack, I can quickly experiment with UX ideas, instrument analytics, and tune performance. The site is a living product: I iterate on content, SEO, and code quality just like I would in production." },

        { type: "heading", level: 1, text: "3. Great orchestrator—blockers don’t block" },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "I’m a strong orchestrator. When a product needs to move but an engineer isn’t available, I don’t let the plan stall. I break the work into thin, testable slices, prototype or code what’s needed, and create momentum so others can join in. I remove ambiguity, write clear docs, and keep decision makers aligned so work continues to flow." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "This approach means blockers don’t block. I validate assumptions quickly, adjust scope to fit constraints, and maintain quality by pairing with engineering and design as soon as they’re free. The result is steady progress and learning loops rather than dead time—shipping becomes the default, not the exception." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Examples: building a thin internal tool while waiting for a vendor API; prototyping flows to gather stakeholder feedback; or drafting content/design so engineering can focus on hard problems. I organize the orchestration so each function plays to its strengths at the right time." },

        { type: "heading", level: 1, text: "4. Strong portfolio (20+ works)" },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "I’ve shipped and contributed to 20+ projects, several of which are live and serving real users today. Highlights include media and streaming at <a href='https://mocaas.tv/' class='text-accent underline'>MocaasTV</a>, mobility at <a href='https://redbus.id' class='text-accent underline'>Redbus</a>, business media at <a href='https://swa.co.id' class='text-accent underline'>SWA</a>, and healthcare at <a href='https://primaya.com' class='text-accent underline'>Primaya</a>." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "This breadth shows I can adapt to different domains and constraints while keeping a high bar for outcomes, UX quality, and delivery speed. I bring context from these launches—analytics, growth, compliance, and stakeholder management—so your team avoids common pitfalls and ships with confidence." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Beyond logos, the wins are measurable: faster time‑to‑ship, fewer support issues, higher activation, and clearer narratives for GTM. I translate portfolio experience into repeatable playbooks your team can use immediately." },

        { type: "heading", level: 1, text: "5. Multi‑utilizer: turns any tool into an advantage" },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "By nature I’m a content builder who also codes—comfortably in Go for backend services, React + TypeScript (and Next.js) for the web, and now even training and integrating LLMs for product workflows. I pick up whatever tool gets us to signal fastest, then deepen as needed to scale. That flexibility is what keeps teams unblocked and learning." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "This isn’t about tech for its own sake. It’s about leverage. When you hire me as a PM, I apply the sharpest tool available: scripting to automate research, prototypes to validate UX, data pipelines to measure impact, or AI to accelerate discovery and support. The point is outcomes—using any capability I have to carry the team toward the goal." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "The result: fewer hand‑offs, tighter feedback loops, and faster compounding gains. I’m comfortable switching hats to keep momentum without sacrificing quality or clarity." },

        { type: "heading", level: 1, text: "6. Deep industry range—rare breadth for a PM" },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "I’ve worked across healthcare, media, mobility, B2B SaaS, and consumer apps. That range helps me recognize patterns fast, avoid domain traps, and import proven playbooks between industries. Few PMs combine this breadth with hands‑on execution, which is why I ramp quickly and contribute from week one." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Industry context matters: compliance in healthcare, latency in media, trust in fintech, and conversion in ecommerce. I’ve shipped in all of them, and I bring that judgment to new problems—choosing the right constraints, the right metrics, and the right order of battles so teams win earlier." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "This experience reduces risk: I know where projects typically stall and how to simplify scope without losing the outcome. Your roadmap gets clearer and your learning loops get shorter." },

        { type: "heading", level: 1, text: "7. Shared targets, not lone‑wolf ownership" },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "I don’t treat product goals as PM‑only wins. I set shared targets with design, engineering, data, and GTM so the score we care about is the same. That builds trust and avoids the anti‑pattern where each function optimizes locally but the product doesn’t move." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "We agree upfront on a few decisive metrics, define the leading indicators, and establish the cadence for review and course correction. Clear targets with joint accountability beat heroics every time." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "The effect is cultural as much as operational: the team feels momentum together and debates become about impact, not territory. That’s how durable results happen." },

        { type: "heading", level: 1, text: "8. Complete PM toolkit—from idea to release" },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "I cover the full PM loop: ideation workshops, customer interviews, JTBD mapping, opportunity sizing, prioritization (RICE/ICE), scoping into thin slices, PRDs and specs, sprint rituals, QA/UAT, and post‑release analysis. I’m comfortable switching altitude between business strategy and technical detail." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "That end‑to‑end skill set shortens hand‑offs and keeps intent intact from discovery to delivery. You get fewer gaps, cleaner docs, and faster iteration because the narrative and the execution stay connected." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "I also maintain a strong writing habit—one‑pagers, ADRs, and change logs—so decisions are transparent and future teammates can onboard quickly." },

        { type: "heading", level: 1, text: "9. User‑centric, products users love" },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "I obsess over the user journey: first‑run experience, empty/loading states, error recovery, and success feedback. These details compound into products people actually enjoy using. I validate with usability tests, analytics funnels, heatmaps, and qualitative notes so improvements are grounded in evidence." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "User love is an outcome of trust and clarity. I remove surprises, reduce cognitive load, and write microcopy that feels human. Strong UX isn’t a coat of paint—it’s a system of choices that respects users’ time and intent." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "As a result, activation and retention improve, support costs drop, and growth gets easier because word‑of‑mouth has something true to talk about." },

        { type: "heading", level: 1, text: "10. Targets over tech debt—focus that makes money" },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Targets are the key. I push for clear, outcome‑based goals and I’m strict about preventing carried‑over work that quietly becomes debt. We design slices we can actually finish, measure, and learn from—protecting both velocity and quality." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "When debt is truly strategic (to learn faster), we track it with owners and due dates, and we pay it down quickly. The default is not to accumulate it. This discipline keeps teams moving toward revenue instead of orbiting maintenance." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "The result is commercial: faster time‑to‑value, cleaner codebases, and a roadmap that reflects real progress rather than rollover lists." },

        { type: "heading", level: 1, text: "11. Powerful communicator and connector" },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "I’m an effective communicator across users, stakeholders, and development teams. I translate between business and engineering without losing nuance, and I write clearly so decisions and trade‑offs are easy to follow." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "Fluent, precise English and confident speaking mean I can lead interviews, run reviews, and present to execs or customers comfortably. I’m the connector who keeps everyone aligned on the outcome, the why, and the next step." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "That middle‑person strength reduces friction: fewer misunderstandings, faster decisions, and a team that spends more time building the right thing together." },
